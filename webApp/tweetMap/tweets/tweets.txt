i don’t really do this twitter thing a lot. do we still say we tweet? anyway, the whole point of this was to remind everyone that @realdonaldtrump is a shit president. i’d love to sit down and have a conversation with him to change my mind. that won’t happen.
@dannyv3 @trustwalletapp desktop version is around the corner, currently in alpha testing.

@ringer skip bayless will probably retweet this w/ glee.
@wholesumfloater @bassbarbie26 i'm so glad you have a bathtub omfg
@kristyswansonxo @kattimpf absurd comparison. gun ownership is a constitutional right. u would have to be pretty creative to call walking across the border a constitutional right. use an anology that is comparable at least. maybe climate change. they are going to do that anyways. with or without precedent
soft
pretending he has power to do so, petulant #manchildtrump @realdonaldtrump threatens to block networks from hosting debates after dems reject #staterunmedia @foxnews.

the potus wasn't sent to change nor save the world. the potus was sent to shake up and wake up the world. so the world can change itself before it's too late.
just a fyi to you all making music; those fees for a pro/digital distribution/etc. might seem annoying but people will just steal your work without bothering to ask (more easily) soon if you don't go through w/ it.

you can still drop your music on bandcamp/soundcloud/etc. too.👍
